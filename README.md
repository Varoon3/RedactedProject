## Modeling a Health Care System

This login-based health care system intends to model a possible solution to alleviating patient wait-times in Canada. By creating univeral waitlists for specialists that family-physicians can refer their patients too, ineffeciencies due to waitlists being clogged in urban areas while open in others are reduced due to increased transparency.

The system also includes epidemiological implications as well, since patient data is available to all physicians with appropriate status. Provinces at risk for certain diseases are marked by patients expressing high-risk gene sequences for certain diseases and ailments. This is to further model the benefits of having a health care system that allows for electronic health records to travel seamlessly through a national health care system.
